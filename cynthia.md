## About Me

This week I’ve discovered that GitHub is so much more than just a place to host code, it’s a **powerful collaboration tool**, and now I see why it’s at the heart of so many open-source and tech projects.

## What I’ve Learned About GitHub

### Repositories
Before now, I knew a repo was a folder that held project files. But I’ve learned how to:
- Create both **public and private repositories**.
- Add meaningful **README.md** files to introduce and document a project.
- Use **branches** to manage different versions or features of a project without messing up the main codebase.

### Branching and Commits
Branching used to confuse me, but now I get it! I’ve learned how to:
- Create a **new branch** to work on a feature or update independently.
- Make **commits** with clear messages that tell the story of what changes were made and why.
- Understand how **commit history** helps keep track of progress and accountability.

### Pull Requests
- I now understand how to **create pull requests** when I want to merge changes from a branch into the main code.
- I’ve seen how PRs are the core of team collaboration, they allow for **code review**, discussion, suggestions, and approval before merging.
- I’ve also learned how to **review** someone else’s PR and leave constructive feedback.

### Cloning, Forking & Contributing
I used to think cloning and forking were the same thing, they’re not!
- **Cloning** is for local work: it pulls a repo to your machine so you can work offline.
- **Forking** is for contributing to someone else’s project, it creates your own copy you can modify and later submit changes through a PR.
- I now know how to fork a repo, create a new branch, make edits, and then push those changes to GitHub and submit a pull request back to the original project.
