# Hey, I'm Fisayo! 🌸

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m a frontend developer with a curious mind, a love for fantasy novels, and a pair of crochet hooks never too far from reach. 🧶📚

## 👩🏽‍💻 Frontend Developer by Day

I build responsive and scalable interfaces using **Next.js**, **React Native**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I’ve worked on full admin dashboards, mobile apps, and e-commerce sites using tools like **Firebase**, **Expo**, and **WooCommerce**. I enjoy breaking down complex UI challenges into reusable components and maintainable code.

## ✍🏽 Technical Writing BootCamp Learnings

Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of technical writing! Through the BootCamp, I’ve learned how to:
- Structure documentation clearly for both devs and non-devs
- Write concise tutorials and how-to guides that are SEO-friendly
- Use tools like Markdown, Git, and Docs-as-Code workflows
- Emphasize clarity, consistency, and user empathy in writing

It’s been eye-opening to learn how documentation is just as much a product as the code itself!

## 🌿 Life Outside the Code

When I'm not coding or writing docs, you’ll probably find me:
- Lost in a fantasy novel—think dragons, magic schools, or rebel princesses
- Crocheting something cozy (yes, I made that hat!)
- Watching anime, Kdrama, or old classic movies

I’m passionate about clean tech, meaningful work, and building things that genuinely make life easier.
