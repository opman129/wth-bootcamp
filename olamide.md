Since the beginning of this bootcamp, my journey has been both exciting and enlightening.
We started with an introduction to technical writing, where I learned the importance of clear, concise communication in the tech world. 
Next, we dove into Markdown, mastering how to format documents efficiently using headers, lists, links, tables, and code blocks. 
This foundation made it easier to create professional, well-structured documents. Recently, we've progressed to version control using Git and GitHub, which opened my eyes to collaborative coding and project management.
Learning how to initialize repositories, create branches, commit changes, and push to remote repositories has given me essential skills to work effectively in team projects and track my workâ€™s history.
