# About me

Hi, I'm Seyitan, a DevOps and Cloud Engineer on a continuous learning journey. This week, I got started with Git via WriteTechHub, one of the most essential tools in software development,DevOps and technical writing.

## What I Learned This Week

This week, I’ve covered several foundational Git concepts, including:

- **Introduction to Git**: Understanding what Git is, why it's used, and how version control works.
- **Branching**: Learned to create and manage branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Pull request and merging**: Learned to create pull requests to propose chnages before merging code into the main branch.
- **SSH Connection**: I learned how to set up SSH keys for secure communication with platforms like GitHub — no more typing passwords!
- **Cloning Repositories**: Learned to use the `git clone` command to copy remote repositories to my local computer.
- **Forking Repositories**: Learned how to indirectly own someone's repo and contribute to it.
- **Collaboration**: Learned how to contribute to shared projects, manage changes, and avoid conflicts when working with a team.


Learning these skills has made me feel more confident using Git and ready to work with others on real projects.
